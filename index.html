          <p class="intro">Kevin Spears entered the workforce straight out of high school. While working on a job for a demolition company Kevin suffers a catastrophic brain injury during a fall. Once he recovers, he realizes that his brain injury has unlocked the ability for him to view past events at will.</p>
          <p>He teams up with a detective on the Virginia State Police force named Sara Simpson and eventually with FBI agents Robert Branson and Mike Carson. No one knows Kevin’s real name or what he looks like. Kevin insists that he remain anonymous for fear that the CIA may learn of his ability and take him into custody to use his ability for whatever they want whenever they want. Kevin feels that this would effectively end his normal way of life. Agent Branson mentions to an old friend at a party that he used a guy with paranormal ability on a case. His friend, Shawn Cousins works for the CIA and the hunt is on!</p>
          <p>The CIA is pulling out all the stops to find Voodoo which is the name agent Branson gave Kevin because he doesn’t know his real name. In the meantime, a terrorist group called the Tripod has been blowing up Hospitals, Hotels and Schools all over Europe, Asia and South America. Rumor has it that the Tripod is coming to the United States and of course every intelligence agency in the world is looking for these guys but the CIA is taking the lead on the possible attack on the U.S. Kevin must decide if he wants to get involved with the very people that he fears the most.</p>

        <h4>Coming 2025</h4>
        <h2 class="bold">Hindsight 20/20</h2>
        <h2 class="sub">The Final Chapter</h2>
        <p>While vacationing in Florida Kevin Spears sees a newscast about a drug cartel kingpin being arrested at the U.S. – Mexican border. Kevin notices some irregularities in the man’s demeaner as well as the circumstances surrounding his arrest. He shrugs it off without another thought and returns home. A few days later Kevin hears that the kingpin has escaped from police custody in Mexico. All the irregularities and concerns that Kevin had had during the arrest came flooding back. Finally, his curiosity gets the better of him and he projects back to watch everything unfold. He is shocked to discover that the CIA, DEA, CNI and the Mexican police are all involved with a joint undercover operation against the cartel. However, Kevin finds that the agent that is undercover inside the cartel has been made. The cartel is feeding him false information in order to set a trap for the law enforcement agencies involved. Kevin realizes that he must let the agencies know about the trap or lives will be lost. He contacts agents Branson, Carson and new FBI recruit Sara Simpson to try to get a message to whoever is running the operation. This propels Kevin along with agents Branson, Carson and Simpson into a massive operation that involves multiple agencies with different agendas trying to work together against a drug cartel that is aware of their every move. There are twists and turns as well as a few surprises as Kevin tries to navigate the minefield created by multiple agencies each promoting their agenda as well as a drug cartel in what proves to be his toughest and perhaps his last case.</p>
