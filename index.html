          <p class="intro">Kevin Spears entered the workforce straight out of high school. While working on a job for a demolition company Kevin suffers a catastrophic brain injury during a fall. Once he recovers, he realizes that his brain injury has unlocked the ability for him to view past events at will.</p>
          <p>He teams up with a detective on the Virginia State Police force named Sara Simpson and eventually with FBI agents Robert Branson and Mike Carson. No one knows Kevin’s real name or what he looks like. Kevin insists that he remain anonymous for fear that the CIA may learn of his ability and take him into custody to use his ability for whatever they want whenever they want. Kevin feels that this would effectively end his normal way of life. Agent Branson mentions to an old friend at a party that he used a guy with paranormal ability on a case. His friend, Shawn Cousins works for the CIA and the hunt is on!</p>
          <p>The CIA is pulling out all the stops to find Voodoo which is the name agent Branson gave Kevin because he doesn’t know his real name. In the meantime, a terrorist group called the Tripod has been blowing up Hospitals, Hotels and Schools all over Europe, Asia and South America. Rumor has it that the Tripod is coming to the United States and of course every intelligence agency in the world is looking for these guys but the CIA is taking the lead on the possible attack on the U.S. Kevin must decide if he wants to get involved with the very people that he fears the most.</p>
